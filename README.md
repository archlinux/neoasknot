# neoasknot

Ask not what `$ORG` can do for you, but what you can do for `$ORG`.

Rewrite of [asknot-ng], which was written by [@ralphbean] and its
[contributors][asknot-ng-contribs], which itself was inspired by the
original [asknot] by [Josh Matthews][jdm], Henri Koivuneva, and
[others][asknot-contribs]. The concept is a basic decision tree.

`neoasknot` is built with [SvelteKit] and [Tailwind CSS] using the [Skeleton] UI
library:<br>
https://whatcanidofor.archlinux.org

## Usage

Clean install the project's development dependencies:

    $ npm ci

Start the dev server:

    $ npm run dev

Build for production and preview the static site:

    $ npm run build
    $ npm run preview

## Deployment

The Arch Linux instance runs on [GitLab Pages][glpages].
There are 2 deployments: one in [staging] and one in [production].

### Staging

Currently this is a bit convoluted and done on gitlab.com (at least until
[multiple version Pages support][multiverpages] is implemented or one of the
proposed solutions is used).

### Production

Push to the `main` branch and GitLab CI will build and publish the site.
