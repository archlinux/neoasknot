# neoasknot

Ask not what `$ORG` can do for you, but what you can do for `$ORG`.

Rewrite of [asknot-ng], which was written by [@ralphbean] and its
[contributors][asknot-ng-contribs], which itself was inspired by the
original asknot by [Josh Matthews][jdm], Henri Koivuneva, and
[others][asknot-contribs]. The concept is a basic decision tree.

`neoasknot` is built with [SvelteKit] and [Tailwind CSS] using the [daisyUI]
component library:<br>
<https://whatcanidofor.archlinux.org>

## Usage

Clean install the project's development dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build for production and preview the static site:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The Arch Linux instance runs on [GitLab Pages][glpages].
There are 2 deployments: one in [staging] and one in [production].

### Staging

Currently this is a bit convoluted and done on gitlab.com (at least until
[multiple version Pages support][multiverpages] is implemented or one of the
proposed solutions is used).

### Production

Push to the `main` branch and GitLab CI will build and publish the site.
