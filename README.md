# neoasknot

Ask not what `$ORG` can do for you, but what you can do for `$ORG`.

Rewrite of [asknot-ng], which was written by [@ralphbean] and its
[contributors][asknot-ng-contribs], which itself was inspired by the
original asknot by [Josh Matthews], Henri Koivuneva, and
[others][asknot-contribs]. The concept is a basic decision tree.

`neoasknot` is built with [SvelteKit] and [Tailwind CSS] using the [daisyUI]
component library: \
<https://whatcanidofor.archlinux.org>

## Usage

Clean install the project's development dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build for production and preview the static site:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The Arch Linux instance runs on [GitLab Pages].

Push to the `main` branch to have CI build and publish the site.

The `staging` branch gets deployed to the [/staging subdirectory][staging].
